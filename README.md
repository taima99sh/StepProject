# Step Application 
  Is a mobile application that acts as an intermediary between students and institutions (universities, companies, and so on ) 
- It enables students to access events from one place easily as desired by including them into categories and the ability to filter them.
- The institution finds a place to publish its events (workshops, courses,  discussion sessions .. etc) and attract the right audience.
